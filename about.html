                            <h4>Lester Dewee</h4>
                            <p class="paragraphText">
                            Lester Dewee is the founder and owner of PrimeTime Training. Dewee is also a head coach at the Bethesda Soccer Club for the U10 and U11 boys teams.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraphText">
                            Dewee was born and raised in Silver Spring, Maryland and he grew up playing for various clubs around the DC Metro Area. At the youth level, Dewee played for the Bethesda Soccer Club, Potomac Fusion, DC United Academy, Crystal Palace USA, and the Olympique De Marseille (France). During his youth career, Dewee received a number of accolades; including, 4x state champion, 2x regional champion, and MLS cup champion with the DC United Academy. Dewee had also played with the Maryland State ODP 92’ team before he was selected to the Region 1 program.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraphText">
                            As an alumnus of the Bethesda Soccer Club, Dewee is listed as being one of the 12 distinguished alumni. Dewee is a former USA youth international who played for the U14, U15, U17, and U20 national teams. Dewee has played for and trialed at a number of elite soccer academies in Europe. He has also been on trial, as well as trained for, clubs such as; Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, PSG, AS Monaco, Lille, Rennes, FC Metz, Olympique De Marseille, St. Etienne, and Bordeaux.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraphText">
                            Olympique De Marseille was the club to tie Dewee down at the age of 15, as he signed with their U16 and U17 academy teams. Dewee’s roommate at Marseille was Jordan Ayew, who is currently playing for Swansea City which is in the English Premier League. After Dewee’s stint at Marseille, he left the French powerhouse to join another Ligue 1 (France) club in Bordeaux where he signed a 3 month deal with their reserve team.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraphText">
                            Dewee returned to America after suffering a number of unfortunate injuries. After a year of intensive rehab, Dewee was able to get back on the field and signed with the DC United U18 Academy team where he led the team to the Academy Playoffs. Despite receiving numerous college offers, Dewee decided to focus his attention on a professional career. Dewee signed a 2 year contract with the Swedish club Angelholms FF, at the age of 19. Dewee played for Angelholms FF for a year before transferring to Bodens BBK.
                            </p>
                            <p class="paragraphText">
                            After scoring 10 goals in 16 games, Dewee, unfortunately, suffered yet another injury that forced him to sit out from the game for 8 months. Upon his return to Sweden, Dewee signed with the Division 2 club, Hogonas BK. After a long and hard season with Hoganas BK, Dewee decided it was time to walk away from the sport due to the constant injury cycle. Today, Dewee is dedicating his life to help young aspiring soccer players. His passion for the sport and for teaching the game combined with all of the experience he has gained over years playing overseas and professionally, has encouraged and motivated him to share all that he has learned with the youth.
